### Why Logofork?  

This product was born out of a problem I faced when switching design software.  
Adobe offered community logo export plugins, but when I moved to **Affinity**, there were no tools to solve this issue.  

**Logofork** works seamlessly with tools like **Illustrator**, **Affinity Designer**, and **Inkscape** — designed to support you across platforms.

### Why Fewer Options?  

Too many options can confuse users.  
Logofork is designed to be **simple**, **intuitive**, and **consistent** for everyone.
