This product was born from a problem I faced when switching design software. Adobe had some community logo export plugins, but when I moved to Affinity, I found no tools to solve this issue.

Logofork works with whatever you are using, be it Illustrator, Affinity Designer, or Inkscape. It's designed to support you across different platforms.
Why fewer options than other similar softwares? I believe more options can confuse users. That's why we keep Logofork simple and consistent for everyone.
